                                                           1. It's inside a <div> with 'container special'.
                                                           2. It has the "highlight" class. -->

  <div class="container"> <!-- This <div> only has the 'container' class, NOT the 'special' class -->
    <p>Regular paragraph</p> <!-- This <p> does NOT have the "highlight" class, so the rule does not apply -->

    <p class="highlight">This paragraph won't be affected</p> <!-- Why does this <p> not match?
          1. Although it has the "highlight" class, its ancestor <div> only has the 'container' class.
          2. The CSS rule specifically requires BOTH 'container' AND 'special' classes on the ancestor <div>.
